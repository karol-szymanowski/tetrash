I am a self-taught software developer with three years of professional experience. Responsibilities in my day-to-day work include designing, maintaining, and building scalable and efficient back-end solutions and infrastructure.

I specialize in javascript (especially typescript) and other technologies such as Kubernetes, AWS, or Firebase. While it's not my main area of ​​expertise, I don't mind occasionally working on the Front-end or doing DevOps tasks (making the development process more reliable, efficient, and enjoyable by automating the repetitive tasks or improving monitoring, etc.).

## PROJECTS & ARTICLES

[Highly available kubernetes cluster runnning on raspberry pi](https://github.com/tetrash/k8s-rpi-cluster-presentation)
> I built a kubernetes cluster that runs on several raspberry pi and serves as my sandbox where I deploy my projects for a fraction of the cost of a cloud solution. I used ansible and k3s to automate the entire process and tools such as helm, prometheus or dex to improve monitoring, access and cluster management.
