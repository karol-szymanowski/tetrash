## PROJECTS & ARTICLES

[Highly available kubernetes cluster runnning on raspberry pi](https://github.com/tetrash/k8s-rpi-cluster-presentation)
> I built a kubernetes cluster that runs on several raspberry pi and serves as my personal sandbox where I deploy my projects for a fraction of the cost of a cloud solution. I used ansible and k3s to automate the entire process and tools such as helm, prometheus or dex to improve monitoring, access and cluster management.
